My friend Simon, an amateur painter, had been working on a portrait of his deceased pet for over a week. After he finally completed it, he stepped back and immediately noticed that he had painted the wrong color for his pet's fur. Just then, his wife saw it and exclaimed, That's exactly how I remember him! I was randomly reminded of this today when I was looking at a picture of my own dog.
