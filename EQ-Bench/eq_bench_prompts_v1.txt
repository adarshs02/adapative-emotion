Brenda: Hanging out? The neighbors called the police, Tessa!
Tessa: Maybe if you weren't so uptight, they wouldn't have to.
Brenda: This is not about me being uptight. This is about you respecting our home.
Tessa: Our home? Or your home?
Brenda: Don't start that again, Tessa.
Tessa: What, the truth? That you'd rather have a perfect little doll than a daughter?
Brenda: That's not fair. I just want you to be responsible.
Tessa: No, you want me to be you.
Brenda: And what's so wrong with that? I've worked hard to give us a good life.
Tessa: A good life? Or a perfect life?
Brenda: What's the difference?
Tessa: The difference is that in a good life, people make mistakes. They mess up, they learn, they grow. In your perfect life, there's no room for error. No room for me.
Brenda: That's not true, Tessa. I just... I don't want you to make the same mistakes I did.
Tessa: Maybe I need to make my own mistakes, Mom.

Cecilia: I sell my work to survive, not to profit. There's a difference.
Brandon: A convenient distinction, I'm sure.

Brandon: And you would prefer I lie? Sugarcoat my words to protect the fragile egos of artists like you?
Cecilia: No, I want you to understand. To empathize. To see the blood, sweat, and tears that go into every stroke, every line.
Brandon: Empathy has no place in critique. It clouds judgement.
Cecilia: And that's why you'll never truly understand art, Brandon. Because you refuse to feel it.
Brandon: And you, Cecilia, will never make it as an artist if you can't separate your work from your emotions.
