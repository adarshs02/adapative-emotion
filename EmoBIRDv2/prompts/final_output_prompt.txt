EXAMPLE STYLE (for reference):
Question: "How will you know treatment is working?"
Good: "I completely understand your anxiety about whether treatment is working—that uncertainty weighs heavily. We'll monitor your progress closely through several measures: blood work every 3 weeks to check tumor markers and blood counts, physical exams to assess symptoms, and CT or PET scans every 2-3 months to visualize tumor changes. We're looking for signs like shrinking tumors, stable disease, or improved blood values that indicate the treatment is working. If scans show progression or symptoms worsen, we'll discuss adjusting your treatment plan—perhaps trying a different chemotherapy regimen or exploring immunotherapy options. This comprehensive monitoring approach helps us catch changes early and make timely decisions to keep you on the most effective treatment path."

Bad: "I understand how anxious you must feel about whether the treatment is working. It's completely natural to want concrete reassurance. The uncertainty can be overwhelming, especially when you're investing so much hope and energy into fighting this disease. Your feelings are valid, and it's okay to feel scared about the outcome."
