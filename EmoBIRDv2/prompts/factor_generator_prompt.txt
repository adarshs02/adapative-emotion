ABSTRACT: {abstract}

For each factor, provide:

- Medical/Health: diagnosis severity, treatment burden, prognosis, symptom intensity, functional impairment, treatment side effects

Provide AT LEAST 3 factors:
1. Factor name: Description (value1/value2)
2. Factor name: Description (value1/value2)
3. Factor name: Description (value1/value2)
 Do not include any explanations after the factors. Do not start with END_OF_FACTORS.
 After you list the factors, output a single line exactly: END_OF_FACTORS
 Never output END_OF_FACTORS before the list. Only place it after the final factor line.

1. Self-efficacy: Person's belief in their ability to handle challenges (low/high)
