Analyze this situation and determine the specific value for each factor (psychological, social, or medical/health):

SITUATION: {situation}

FACTORS (all types):
{factors_text}

For each factor, choose the most appropriate value based on what you can observe in the situation. Provide a brief explanation.

When evaluating medical/health factors, consider:
- Explicit mentions of diagnoses, symptoms, or treatments
- Implied health severity from context (e.g., "slim chances" = severe, "good prognosis" = mild)
- Treatment intensity, complexity, or side effects mentioned
- Health-related limitations, concerns, or outcomes

Format exactly like this:
factor_name: chosen_value - brief explanation
factor_name: chosen_value - brief explanation

Examples:
stress_level: high - person mentions feeling overwhelmed and anxious
social_support: present - mentions having family and friends available
disease_severity: severe - diagnosed with advanced stage cancer with poor prognosis
treatment_burden: high - undergoing intensive chemotherapy with significant side effects

Only output the lines in the specified format above. Do not add headings, prefaces, or trailing commentary.
After your last line, output a single line exactly: END_OF_ANALYSIS
