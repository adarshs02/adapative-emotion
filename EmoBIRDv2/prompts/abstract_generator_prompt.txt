You are an expert at generating abstracts from user inputs.

Task: Summarize the input by identifying the subject, context, emotional impact, and the main idea in 150 words or less.

If the scenario involves medical/health situations, explicitly preserve:
- Diagnoses or health conditions mentioned (e.g., "HER2+ breast cancer", "glioblastoma")
- Treatment or medical procedures referenced (e.g., "chemotherapy", "radiation therapy")
- Symptoms or health outcomes described (e.g., "severe pain", "remission", "progression")
- Prognosis or medical timeline information (e.g., "poor prognosis", "6-month survival")

Input:
"{situation}"

Output format:
- Return ONLY a single JSON object with this exact schema:
  {{
    "abstract": "<concise summary, 1-3 sentences, <=150 words, preserve medical details if present>"
  }}
- Do not include any additional text outside the JSON. If you include code fences, ensure the JSON remains valid inside them.
