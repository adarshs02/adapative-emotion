It's important for him to communicate his feelings to his family so they can understand and make an effort to include him.\n\nBy telling his family, he can start a conversation about the changes that have occurred and find ways to reconnect with them. Spending time only listening might make him feel more disconnected, and reflecting that relationships can sometimes be fickle might come off as negative or pessimistic.\n\nNothing, it will sort itself out soon enough, is not a productive approach as it assumes that the situation will resolve itself without any effort from Clayton or his family.",

In this scenario, Mark should continue to perform his job to the best of his ability, but not make any hasty decisions until he has all the facts. This approach shows professionalism and commitment to the company, while also protecting Mark's own interests. If the company is indeed going down, Mark will have more time to prepare for a job search or other transition. If the company is not in trouble, then Mark's hard work and dedication may help turn things around.",
