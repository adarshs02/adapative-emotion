He is vindictive to a lesser extent, as he is not trying to harm ARIES-9 but rather express his frustration. He is gloomy because he is disappointed that his argument is not convincing ARIES-9. He is detached because he is discussing the topic with a machine, which may make him feel somewhat disconnected from the conversation.\n\nRevised scores:\nFrustrated: 9\nVindictive: 2\nGloomy: 5\nDetached: 4\n\n[End of answer]",
