After being late twice last month, Pat and I were both late again today, and we missed an important team meeting with the department director this morning. As expected, our team manager called us out on this issue. When the manager met with Pat, I was outside of the manager's office and I overheard their conversation. The manager said to Pat: \"Why were you late to the meeting? It was an important meeting. Do you have any problem? Last month, you had been arriving late to work two times. I didn't give you any warnings because I knew your situation at that time. I think you suffer from the same issue and I understand it would be difficult to handle it. As your friend, I am really worried about you and your career. Next time, don't be late to the meeting and work. If you could not make, please let me know in advance. If you need my help, please let me know. Okay?\".After Pat's meeting, I also talked with the manager. I was feared because the manager didn't give me a chance to explain why I could not attend the meeting. The manager with a serious look on his face said to me: \"Do you know why I called you out? You were late to the meeting and it was an important meeting with the department director. You had been late to work twice last month. At that time, I gave you two verbal warnings. This is the last verbal warning. Don't be late next time. If you are late again, I have to give you a written warning and this will be placed in your employee file and impact your performance evaluation according to the company policies.\"",
